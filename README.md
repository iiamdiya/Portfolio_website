As a web developer, I always strive to bring a creative touch to my projects, and my latest personal portfolio website is no exception. I wanted to showcase my skills and personality, and what better way to do so than through a portfolio website?ðŸ¤©

While building this website, I had a blast incorporating a circle moon that changes the light and dark theme, giving the website a unique look and feel. But I didn't stop there. I also added an animated purple cursor that adds an extra level of interactivity to the site.ðŸŒ’

The contact page was also a crucial aspect of the website, and I made sure it was user-friendly and straightforward. With emailjs integrated, visitors can easily send me an email without having to leave the website.ðŸš€

The animated text that I added to the website dynamically changes, showcasing my interests. With this feature, visitors can easily see the breadth and depth of my expertise in web development, making it easy for them to understand what I bring to the table.ðŸ’»

Overall, I am thrilled with how my portfolio website turned out and I can't wait to share it with the world. I hope it showcases my passion for web development and my creative spirit. Check it out and let me know what you think!
